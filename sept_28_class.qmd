"!=" is opposite of an operator

"!" is always with logical (TRUE/FALSE)

"-" is always with index (exclude a variable)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
starwars

starwars |>
  filter(is.na(mass) == FALSE)

starwars |>
  filter(!is.na(mass))

starwars |>
  drop_na(mass)
```

All three of the above are the way to remove NA from a specific variable

```{r}
starwars |>
  drop_na()
```

The above removes ANYTHING with NA
